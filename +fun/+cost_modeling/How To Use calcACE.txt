--- HOW TO USE calcACE ---

After running calcACE, a prompt will appear in the command window
asking for the average power at each sea state, entered as a vector
	- Sea states must be entered in order
	- These values can be stored in a vector (the script will
	  accept the vector name as an input)

Next, you will be prompted to enter the mass (in metric tonnes) of 
each material contained in the WEC
	- The script is expecting a vector with 7 entries, so enter 
	  zeroes for any material not used
	- These values can be stored in a vector (the script will
	  accept the vector name as an input)



Refer to "Methodology to Calculate the ACE and HPQ Metrics Used in 
the Wave Energy Prize" for a description of the calculations.

This document is here to describe how this script works at the
moment. I would be happy to answer questions about it, or to 
assist in modifying the script for use in other applications.
